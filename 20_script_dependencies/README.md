# SCRIPT DEPENDENCIES

Demonstrate how to write scripts that pack their dependencies.  

NOTES:

* This is an amazing example of using multiple shebangs to ensure that dependencies are available.  

## üè† Build and Run

```sh
# build nix
docker build -t nix-script-dependencies .

# debugging and host repo in build folder
docker run -v $(pwd)/.:/build -it --entrypoint /bin/sh nix-script-dependencies
```

## Example

Running the script ensure all of it's listed dependencies are installed on first execution.  

```sh
# running this script 
./script.sh
```
