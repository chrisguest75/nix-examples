Demonstrate some examples of Nix in `docker`.  

‚ÑπÔ∏è NOTE: Use [playground](##Example-0---Nix-playground) to test if you'd prefer not to install Nix.

## Conventional Commits

NOTE: This repo has switched to [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0). It requires `pre-commit` and `commitizen` to help with controlling this.  

```sh
# install pre-commmit (prerequisite for commitizen)
brew install pre-commit
brew install commitizen
# conventional commits extension
code --install-extension vivaxy.vscode-conventional-commits

# install hooks
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg --hook-type pre-push
```

## Nix

Nix is a powerful and flexible package manager for Unix-based systems, such as Linux and macOS. It was created to address some of the limitations and problems associated with traditional package managers like apt, yum, and pacman. Nix provides a reliable and reproducible way of managing software packages and their dependencies.  

Some key features of Nix include:

* Declarative package management: Users can describe the desired software environment in a declarative language called Nix expressions. This allows for easy sharing, reproducibility, and version control of software environments.

* Isolation of package dependencies: Nix stores packages in isolation from each other, which prevents dependency conflicts and simplifies the process of upgrading, rolling back, or removing packages.

* Atomic upgrades and rollbacks: Nix supports atomic operations, meaning that upgrading or rolling back a package does not affect the rest of the system. If an upgrade fails or a package causes issues, you can easily revert to the previous version without any consequences.

* Multi-user support: Nix allows multiple users on a single system to have their own software environments without interfering with one another. This is particularly useful in shared or managed environments like research labs, universities, or workplaces.

* Source and binary packages: Nix can build packages from source code or use precompiled binaries. This allows for greater flexibility and choice in how software is installed and managed.

* NixOS: Nix is also the basis for NixOS, a Linux distribution built entirely around the Nix package manager. NixOS takes the principles of Nix and applies them to the entire operating system, resulting in a highly customizable, reproducible, and maintainable system.

Overall, Nix is a powerful package management solution that aims to make managing software on Unix-based systems more reliable, flexible, and reproducible.

## Glossary

The is a glossary file [here](./GLOSSARY.md) with a few terms used from Nix.  

## üè† Install Nix

* [Install-Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) guide
* Install vscode extension

```sh
code --install-extension bbenoist.Nix
```

Check the installation:  

```sh
# check the daemon is running
systemctl status nix-daemon

systemctl start nix-daemon      

# show help
nix-env --help
# a quick test of nix-shell
nix-shell -p nix-info --run "nix-info -m"
```

## Index and Locate files

```sh
nix-env -iA nixpkgs.nix-index
nix-shell -p nix-index

# NOTE: THis seems to fail inside a container.  
nix-index  

# Try to find ldd inside packages
nix-locate ldd
```
